Dataset
This project utilizes the following datasets:

CASIAV2.0 Dataset: The CASIAV2.0 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for face anti-spoofing. It contains a large collection of real and fake face images captured under various conditions.

140k Real vs Fake Faces Dataset: This dataset comprises 140,000 face images labeled as either real or fake. It is commonly used for training and evaluating deep learning models in the field of face manipulation detection.

PS-Battles Dataset: The PS-Battles dataset consists of images collected from Photoshop battle forums, where users engage in digital image editing competitions. This dataset contains a variety of manipulated and edited images.
